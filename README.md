# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware ‚Äì PCs
2. Anaconda ‚Äì Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Read the number of variables n. Create an augmented matrix a of size ùëõ√ó(ùëõ+1) to hold coefficients and constants.

2.Create a solution vector x of size n.

3.For each pivot row, check if the pivot element is zero (exit if true). For all rows below the pivot, eliminate the variable using row operations.

4.Start from the last equation and solve for one variable at a time, moving upwards.

5.Print each variable X0, X1, ..., Xn-1 with 2 decimal precision.

## Program:
```

x=np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j]=float(input())
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i]==0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected!')
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio=a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
x[n-1]=a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i]=a[i][n]
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i]=x[i]-a[i][j]*x[j]
    x[i]= x[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.02f'%(i,x[i]), end=' ')
```
